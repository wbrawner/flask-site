            <h3>interval timer app</h3>
            <p><a href="http://interval-timer.wbrawner.com/" target="_blank" class="logo-link"><img class="project-logo" style="max-width: 102px; border-radius: 50%;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/interval-timer.png')  }}"></a>The interval timer app was a little experiment of mine to learn AngularJS and try something new. When I wrote it, I was using FirefoxOS on my phone, and working out from my apartment. While there were apps that ran an interval timer, there was no app that allowed you to customize the intervals for the timer. All of them basically gave you the times and cycles, and you had to comply. I decided that that wasn't good enough for me, so I threw together this app and published it to the Firefox Marketplace. Later, once FirefoxOS was discontinued, I migrated back to Android, and published the app in the Google Chrome Webstore. </p>
            <p>The interval timer app is completely open source, but as of this moment, I'm the only contributor. If you're interested, you can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/wbrawner/interval-timer">GitHub</a></p>

            <h3>workout generator app</h3>
            <p><a href="http://workout-generator.wbrawner.com/" target="_blank" class="logo-link"><img class="project-logo" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/workout-generator.png')  }}"></a>Back when I was first learning Python, I wanted to put my skills to the test, so I did various programming challenges in order to learn new things and practice what I already knew. They were fun, but I wanted to try something that was a little more along the lines of my personal interests. Having grown up in a gym, I figured it would be cool to write up a workout generator. Sure enough, I ended up doing it and got it to be fully functional, on the command line. Most people, however, don't tend to use a command line so it probably would have never gone anywhere. Since my work at the time required I write code in PHP, and sometimes use the Laravel framework, I decided to translate the app and rebuild it as a web app instead of a command line program. It's still a work in progress, and will certainly need a fresh design once it's finished, but you're welcome to check it out and use it in the meantime.</p>
            <p>The workout generator app is also completely open source. Likewise, I'm the only contributor, but I hope to see that change in the future. If you're interested, you can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/wbrawner/workoutgenerator-app">GitHub</a>. The original, Python version is also available on <a href="https://github.com/wbrawner/workout-generator-cli">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h3>sinconsa consultores</h3>
            <p><a href="http://sinconsa.com" target="_blank" class="logo-link"><img class="project-logo"  src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/sinconsa.png')  }}"></a>Sinconsa Consultores is a business operated by a friend a former co-worker of mine. This was my very first professional web development project. When I first wrote it, I had a very limited knowledge of web development, and wrote out all 15 or so pages using only HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. This was obviously ridiculous, and incredibly inefficient to make updates. With these factors in mind, it made sense to power the website with WordPress, so I was given the opportunity to make the migration.</p>

            <p><a href="http://wbrawner.com/" target="_blank" class="logo-link"><img class="project-logo" style="max-width: 102px; border: 0;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/favicon.png')  }}"></a>This site that you're looking at right now was also built by yours truly. It began as a basic HTML/CSS single-page website, then I decided to charge it up with WordPress and move a few things to their own pages. The motivation behind this move was that I had been using WordPress quite a bit in my work at the time, so I wanted to learn the ins and outs in order to do my job better. Some time later, I stopped getting so many WordPress tasks and so my desire to learn it faded a bit. I have nothing against WordPress, but I wanted to get back to my Python roots, and have a bit more control over everything running. Thus, I rewrote my website in Python using Flask, not for work or any other professional necessity, but simply for the joy of writing code in a language I'm more familiar with.</p>
            <p>I decided to make my personal website open source as well. If you're interested, you can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/wbrawner/flask-site">GitHub</a></p>
